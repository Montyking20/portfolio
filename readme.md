##  What is the project?

In our second assignment we were required to create an app from scratch: 

- The app was required to have an image of the developer and their name. 

- Have a top navbar that when clicking on the links the page navigates to the about me of the developer, the developers work and the developers contact info.

- When clicking on the developers images of their work the image it takes yo to that deployed application.

- The app is also required to e responsive and adapts to different screen sizes.

## Completed steps

- Header has name and a navbar that deploys to About me, Work, and Contact me.

- Created 3 images of my apps with most recent app larger above the 4 other apps. Two cards are just filler till I add other projects.

- Created contact links for my linkedin, github, email and phone number.

- Added hover to image links, animated background and made it media friendly.
